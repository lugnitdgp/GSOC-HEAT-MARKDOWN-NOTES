## Getting involved

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

If you wish to contribute, please open a **new issue** before making any pull request. **Every pull request should
have a reference to an issue.**


### Making your your first pull request

- First, fork this repository
- Clone it using ``` git clone https://github.com/lugnitdgp/GSOC-HEAT-MARKDOWN-NOTES.git ```
- It is always recommended to make your changes in a new branch rather than master.
  So create a new branch using ``` git branch mybug ```
- Checkout into your new branch using ``` git checkout mybug ```
- Hack the code, and do all kinds of awesome stuff.
- After you are done add your changes using ``` git add --all```
- Commit your changes using ``` git commit ``` and provide a commit message.
- After you have committed your changes push your changes to your forked repository
  using ``` git push origin mybug ```
- Finally create a pull request from github.
- If everything is alright then soon your changes will get merged or else you will
  be asked to make changes.

There should be **only one commit per pull request**.

Please try to make sure that your commit message and body follows the
guidelines below.

- Commit message should be of the form : ``` Fixes issue #[issue_number] - what you solved in one line ```
- After commit message, there should be a commit body where you can mention what you did in short or in detail

Please try to follow this format as it will be helpul for maintainers as well as co-developers/contributors
to stay aligned.
